# Udacity Project: Create a Tableau Story
[Tableau link](https://public.tableau.com/profile/228149966#!/vizhome/Part3Project/StoryofCancellations)
## Summary
In this project, I have chosen the dataset from RITA ichi is about the US flights delay and cancelled data in 2008. In the dataset, the origins and destinations, the flights number and airlines, the delay time and delay code, and other information are given. By analyzing this dataset, we can have a clear view about the flights delays and give us some insight on how to improve it.

## Design
The first sheet of this project is look at the delays in each month, and we will have an idea about how the number of delays are changing. Besides, we also need to look at the cancelled and diverted flights in each month. For cancelled flights, we can look at the cancellations with different code. We can also find which origin and destination have the most cancellations. Since we have the data of carriers, we can find which company has the most cancellations and their cancellations in each month. Because we know the origins and destinations, we can also have geographic visualizations about the cancellations, diverted flights, origins and destinations. Besides, we can also add filter to look at in each month, which city has most cancellations. 

In the first dashboard, I put the cancellations by code together with cancellations and diverted flights by month. In the second dashboard, I put cancellations by origin and destination airport together. In this way we can have a better understanding of the cancellations by month, by code, by origins and destinations.

In the story, I put together all the sheets related to cancellations to finalize the story.

## Feedback
* What do you notice in the visualization?
	* Way too much text
	* Lack of title for all plots, use column plot for all time period plot. 
* What questions do you have about the data?
	* What does the cancellation code stand for?
* What relationships do you notice?
	* Information is in accordance with section tap
	* This is a nice touch.
* What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?
	* The main reason having this visualization is clear, however things can be improve.
* Is there something you donâ€™t understand in the graphic?
	* Most plots are self-explanatory.
